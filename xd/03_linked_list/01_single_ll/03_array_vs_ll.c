/*
1. accessing -> Array wins
2. memory wastage -> ll wins
3. insertion / deletion
    a. at the begining  |O(n)| |O(1)|
    b. at end |O(1)| |O(n)|
    c. at nth position |O(n)| |O(n)|
4. easy to use --> array wins
5. linear and binary search are possible in array
    only linear is possible in ll.
