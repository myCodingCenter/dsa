## Linked List

It is a linear data structure. Collection of nodes. Nodes structure where can be store data and address of upcoming node. First node is called head and last one is call tail.

non-continuous memory location

tail is end with null value

### why not use array

- insertion  
- deletion

- can be create stacks, quess

### when to use what

- ready heavy go for array
- write heavpy got for linked list
